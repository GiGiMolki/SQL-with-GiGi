## What Is SQL?

SQL (often pronounced *"sequel"*) is the standard language used to manage and query data in **relational databases**.

- Originally proposed as **DSL/Alpha** by E.F. Codd.
- Evolved into **SQUARE**, then **SEQUEL**, and finally **SQL**.
- Standardized by **ANSI** in 1986, with updates in 1989, 1992, 1999, 2003, and 2006.
- SQL:2006 introduced **XML integration** and the **XQuery** language.

### Key Facts:
- SQL queries return data as **tables** (called **result sets**).
- You can create **permanent tables** from query results.
- SQL uses both existing tables and query results as inputs.
- Not officially an acronym, but commonly called **Structured Query Language**.

> âœ… Tip: You can say **S.Q.L.** or **sequel** â€” both are correct!

## SQL Statement Classes

SQL is broadly divided into three key statement classes:

### 1. **SQL Schema Statements** (DDL â€“ Data Definition Language)
Used to define database structure.

```sql
CREATE TABLE corporation (
  corp_id SMALLINT,
  name VARCHAR(30),
  CONSTRAINT pk_corporation PRIMARY KEY (corp_id)
);
```

ðŸ“Œ *Defines a new table `corporation` with `corp_id` as the primary key.*

---

### 2. **SQL Data Statements** (DML â€“ Data Manipulation Language)
Used to insert, update, delete, or query data.

```sql
INSERT INTO corporation (corp_id, name)
VALUES (27, 'Acme Paper Corporation');
```

ðŸ“Œ *Inserts a new row into the `corporation` table.*

```sql
SELECT name
FROM corporation
WHERE corp_id = 27;
```

ðŸ“Œ *Retrieves the name for corporation with `corp_id = 27`.*

---

### 3. **SQL Transaction Statements** (TCL â€“ Transaction Control Language)
Used to manage transactions (e.g., `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`).

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus: Metadata & Data Dictionary

- All schema elements are stored in a **data dictionary** (metadata).
- You can **query metadata** using `SELECT` to explore current database structure dynamically.

### Summary Table

| Class                | Key Commands                     | Purpose                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| DDL (Schema)         | CREATE, ALTER, DROP              | Define database structure            |
| DML (Data)           | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE   | Work with actual data                |
| TCL (Transaction)    | BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK          | Manage transactions                  |
| Metadata (Info only) | SELECT from info_schema, etc.    | Explore database structure/runtime   |

## SQL: A Nonprocedural Language

Unlike procedural languages (like C, Java, Python), SQL is **nonprocedural**.

### ðŸ†š Procedural vs Nonprocedural

| Aspect               | Procedural Language                  | SQL (Nonprocedural)                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Control              | You control the *how*                | You define *what*                       |
| Constructs           | Loops, if-else, functions, etc.      | No control structures                   |
| Execution            | Follows exact instructions           | Optimizer decides execution path        |

### ðŸ§  SQL Optimizer
- The **optimizer** (part of the DB engine) determines how to execute SQL queries efficiently.
- You define **inputs and outputs** â€” the DB figures out the *process*.
- You can use **hints** to guide it (advanced use).

### ðŸ”Œ SQL + Programming Languages

SQL needs to be integrated into a host language for complete applications.

| Language       | Toolkit/API                            |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Java           | JDBC                                   |
| C++            | Rogue Wave SourcePro DB                |
| C/C++          | Oracle Pro*C, MySQL C API, IBM DB2 CLI |
| C# / VB        | ADO.NET                                |
| Python         | Python DB (DB-API)                     |
| Perl           | Perl DBI                               |

> ðŸ›  Most DBs offer CLI + GUI tools for running SQL interactively.

For example, MySQL includes the `mysql` CLI tool for writing and testing SQL queries directly.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Insight:**  
> SQL lets you describe **what** data you want, not **how** to get it â€” thatâ€™s the job of the database engine.

## What Is MySQL?

### ðŸ§± MySQL is an open-source **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**.

- Competes with commercial RDBMSs like:
  - **Oracle Database**
  - **Microsoft SQL Server**
  - **IBM DB2**
  - **Sybase Adaptive Server**

### ðŸ†“ Why MySQL?
- Free and open-source.
- Easy to download, install, and use.
- Over **10 million installations** worldwide.
- Compatible with most SQL standards.

> All examples in this repo are based on **MySQL 6.0** using the `mysql` command-line tool.
